# horiseon-accesibility-refactor

## Description

In order to be more inclusive and to optimize the client's exposure online, I refactored Horiseon's homepage. My work included replacing old html syntax with semantic elements, adding image alt descriptions, and cleaning the stylesheet so the code can be as concise as possible, following DRY theory.
